# trafficlight_system
Traffic light project written in Racket using the Asip library

### General Idea
Our system would have to support a traffic light system that could run with and without human input. We implemented a system that was required all components to work together to assure success. We did this by building a 'central' point that would have the other lights either copy or inverse the output that was given.
